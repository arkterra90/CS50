Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: None, I predicted the more simulations ran the longer it would take.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: running more than 10000 simulations seems to greatly deminish the speed of the code. I would stop there.
