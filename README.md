# CS50
#### A repository created to house my work in [Harvards CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x): Introduction To Computer Science


This is CS50x through edX, Harvard University's introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. Taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently.The Problem Sets are inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. It also teaches students how to develop and present a final programming project.

***

Wherever possible, I had attempted the more comfortable versions of the Labs & Problem Sets as well as attempted all the Weekly Practice Problems. This repository will be updated constantly as I continue to complete this course. The Final Project, [Yard Water](https://github.com/arkterra90/Yard_Water), has been added to a separate repository.
